// SchemaCache accumulates named types across multiple [SchemaCache.Parse]
// calls, allowing schemas to reference types defined in previously parsed
// schemas — the shape a Schema Registry's inter-schema references take.
//
// Schemas must be parsed in dependency order: referenced types must be
// parsed before the schemas that reference them.
//
// Parsing the same schema string more than once is allowed and returns the
// previously parsed result, so diamond dependencies (A→B→D, A→C→D) need no
// caller-side tracking. Options that change what the string compiles to —
// custom types or [WithLaxNames] — skip this deduplication and re-parse, since
// the string alone no longer identifies the result. Deduplication normalizes
// JSON whitespace and key order but not the Avro canonical form: schemas
// differing only in formatting dedupe, while differences in non-canonical
// fields like doc or aliases return a duplicate type error.
//
// Each returned [*Schema] is fully resolved and independent of the cache. That
// extends to sub-schemas: a node extracted from [Schema.Root] converts via
// [SchemaNode.Schema] with every cross-parse reference resolved, so the cache
// is never needed again once Parse returns.
//
// [WithLaxNames] is sticky: if a type is defined with it, pass it to every
// later Parse that references that type. A schema containing a lax name is not
// parseable without it, cache or no cache, so the referencing Parse's
// [Schema.String] and [Schema.Canonical] output also needs WithLaxNames to
// re-parse. [Schema.Encode] and [Schema.Decode] are unaffected either way.
//
// The zero value is ready to use. A SchemaCache is safe for concurrent use.
